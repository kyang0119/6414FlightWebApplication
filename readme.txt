I have inplemented all the requirements of assignments4 , please let me know if you have any questions , contact : kxy200010@utdallas.edu.

how to use the program : 


1. for question 1,  the professor wants us to create the table based on user input , so please choose One way or Round trip and enter user input to search the result.
click on "see search result", it will create flight table based on user input and you can choose one or multiple of them. If you have searched once but want 
to do another search, you have to refresh the page before the second search. if you have searched for single flight , and then want to search for round trip,
it's ok, no need to refresh page, because they are different search form. You only need to refresh the page if you want to do several sesearches on the same form. 

2. questions 2, 3 is similar to question1 , you have to enter user input so the program will generate the table based on user input. remember to refresh before each search. 

3. question 4,5,6 ask us to parse XML and get in table, that is the first table showing at page load. 

3. All the page have My Cart button , so you can see all the information on any page. 

4. sessionStorage automatically saves data inbetween refreshes. If you want to get rid of saved data, just close the tab and reopen. 

5. all the radio buttons, if you have selected it , unselected it , and then want to select again , you have to refresh the page.

6. use chrome.
